                <h2>Mitochondria, Aging & PBM</h2>
                <p>
                    Mitochondria are the motors in the body that produce ATP. ATP is the fuel that cells use to thrive. A current theory on aging suggests that as we age, the mitochondria become damaged by free radicals and toxicity.  Photobiomodulation, has been shown in research to slow, halt and even reverse Mitochondrial Dysfunction and improve production of ATP.
    
                </p>
                <p>
                    A whole body LED Light Therapy Bed delivers photons of different wavelengths throughout the body.  The action of improving mitochondrial function improves cellular energy and slows cell death.  Improving cellular health and longevity is considered a key factor in aging.   The benefits cascade to create improvements in cognition, wellness, performance and aesthetics.

        <p>
            Over 4000 studies suggest that light heals. Like a multivitamin, full body LED light therapy beds stimulates key cellular reactions that improve the health, energy and function of cells.  These studies suggest the benefits of light as a supplement include reduced inflammation, detoxification of waste and free radicals, improved circulation, and improved energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            An LED Light Therapy Bed illuminates the entire body with photons that trigger cellular reactions which may cascade down into and affect the tissues, organs and systems.  You just get better.

            <p>
                Athletes who break their own personal best records after supplementing with a full body LED light therapy bed have performance as a measurable benchmark.  Professional sports franchises are building recovery centers that utilize full body photobiomodulation beds to help their athletes prevent mechanical injuries of competition (preconditioning), speed recovery after competition and improve peak performance in the areas of strength, speed and endurance during competition.

            </p>
            <p>
                People suffering from pain or illness have the reduction of pain or illness as a benchmark. In both cases, LED light therapy is triggering cellular changes that cascade down into and change the tissues organs and systems which improves how their bodies are performing.

            <h2>LED or Laser?</h2>
            <p>
                Studies have shown that LASERS and LED’s can have very similar effects depending on the intensity. Low Level Lasers may prove more effective in targeting inside of a joint while a full body light therapy bed may better precondtion the entire body, helping it respond better to localized treatments with lasers.

            </p>
            <p>
                Lasers are much more effective for invasive procedures designed to cut or burn while LED’s may prove better for systemic stimulation of health. LED’s are non-invasive but researchers suggest that the right dose can have similar benefits without invasive injuries.

            <h2>Targeting, Dose & Multiple Wavelengths</h2>
            <p>
                Like a multivitamin supplement, multiple LED Light Therapy bed wavelengths may trigger different reactions in the cells. As the science of photobiomodulation research improves we believe that wavelengths, pulse and dose will become more specialized.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Spa owner interested in skincare might be better suited with a mid energy system. A doctor stimulating deeper healing might find more power is better due to the increased penetration.  A business owner wants both effectiveness and shorter treatment times to ROI their investment.  A professional athlete might find that Red/NIR is the best choice while someone with skin issues will benefit from adding green.

                <p>
                    Whole Body LED Light Therapy beds are about luxury, precision and efficacy. A photobiomodulation bed allows for the correct dose, without overstimulation (damage) in the shortest time frame possible.  Optimized intensities mean program times are reduced and comfort is increased.  Regulation of distance to the LED source in a bed creates the precise distance required to optimize dose.  This improves efficacy by maximizing penetration without overstimulating.  The ARRC LED ATP system is optimized for 10 minutes or shorter treatment times in a continuous current format and 12 – 15 minutes or shorter utilizing the pulse.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of whole body photobiomodulation beds or full body LED light therapy is to create systemic benefits of detoxification, improved circulation and improved energy throughout the entire body.

                Irradiance, is the intensity of  light as measured ‘on the skin’ in mw/cm2 units of power.  Distance as measured from the LED to the skin has a profound effect on irradiance.  Dose in LED Light Therapy is a measure of irradiance x time and called a Joule.  Research suggests that 50 Joules per cm2 of energy may be peak dose.  Delivering more energy or too frequently may prove to be less effective for users.

            Different light wavelengths and intensities can create different outcomes in the body. If we know the wavelength and intensity, then we should be able to direct the system to create predictable reactions in the body. In this section we offer a high level explanation of the physics of light as applied to our systems.
